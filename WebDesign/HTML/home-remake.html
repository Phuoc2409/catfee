                <p>The Best Coffee Maker In The Town</p>
                <p>It’s hard to go wrong with cafes in Paris – croissants, pain au chocolat and steaming hot coffee can be found on almost every street corner. Le Cafe Des Chats is no exception. The food is impeccable (we had brunch, croissants included!). The cats, like the French stereotype, are slightly aloof, but one excitable kitten quickly warmed to me and jumped into my arms.</p>

                       Cat Cafés and Entrepreneurialism:<br>
                       Whiskers and Tails Cat Café<br>
                       INTRODUCTION<br><br>
                       Does the idea of a cat café intrigue you? Whiskers and Tails is a first of its kind — not just for Reno, but the entire state of Nevada. You probably wonder, “What is a cat cafe?”  Whiskers and Tails Cat Café is a cat themed restaurant where you can enjoy delicious food and beverages, complete with kitty cat fun all in one place. We’re bringing together adorable, adoptable kitties and a relaxed café all in a setting that makes you feel cozy at home. 
                       <br>OBJECTIVE<br><br>
                       Our prime objective is to find forever homes for stray and shelter cats by partnering with local cat rescues, while also teaching guests about how to build the best kitty/human relationship. Our cat café is also
                       Some of our furry friends come from city shelters, found on the street, and others have been given up by their former owners.<br>Our partnering shelters include the SPCA Northern Nevada Adoption Center and the Nevada Humane Society. Our animals have not been purchased from breeders and we encourage saving lives by adopting from shelters rather than for-profit breeders whose practices are unregulated. Whiskers and Tails will be a no-kill adoption center, and cats that have not been adopted are able to make Whiskers and Tails a forever home or until adoption takes place. Upon arrival, cats are placed in a private, separate “Welcome Room” to become introduced to their new surroundings and environment. In the Welcome Room, they have the opportunity to meet other cats and the staff, play with toys, and establish a sense of comfort. We do not accept found/unwanted cats from customers, because we need to ensure that each cat is not exposed to new and dangerous germs. All cats have been seen by a veterinarian, are up to date on vaccines (for their age), tested for any diseases, microchipped, and dewormed. All cats at the cafe are available for adoption and have been screened for health and behavior issues to verify that they will get along well with other cats and human visitors; however, if you decide to adopt, we will also provide you with a list of local veterinarians who will provide a free or discounted exam to adopted
                       To properly care and feed our kitties, there will be a $5 fee upon entrance. Please remember that all cats must be handled with care. Our furry friends may be petted and held, and a variety of fun toys are made available for playtime. We do ask that children under 18 must be supervised by an adult within the cat lounging area. For safety precautions and health risks, cats are groomed daily and nails are properly kept trimmed.
